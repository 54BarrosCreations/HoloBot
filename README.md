# HoloBot
A sample Unity project for Microsoft HoloLens that lets you interact with a floating robot head using speech recognition, and getting answers spoken back by the "bot" using Text-to-Speech. The commands sent to the bot are powered by the Microssoft Bot Framework and LUIS from Microsoft Cognitive Services.
